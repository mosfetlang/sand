# Sand

A simple very low level language similar to LLVM and near assembler.

This repository contains a library that can be used to parse and compile a program in `Sand` for some architectures, including a custom VM.
Moreover, it will include two crates with a cli and a VM.

## Why the name?

Simply because `Sand` is from where the silicon is got so it is the raw format of [Mosfet], my bigger project.
